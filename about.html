    <h1 class="About">ABOUT PIC-WILD</h1>
    <p class="AW">My name is Fletcher Zulu. I live in the beautiful African country of Zambia. 
     Over the years, I have visited most of the national parks in Zambia, as well as 
     other African countries. During these visits, I was accompanied
     by family and friends, and we had the opportunity to take a lot of wildlife pictures.(These pictures were taken in different African countries) 
     I was inspired to build a website for these pictures so that you can see the magnificent 
     creations of God and witness His glory through them.
